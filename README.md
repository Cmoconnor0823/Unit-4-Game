# Unit-4-Game
Welcome to Crystal Collector!

This is a simple game wherein the user attempts to guess a random number generated by the computer, through a series of button clicks.
At game load the computer will guess a random number between 19 - 120 while each of the 4 buttons at the user's disposal will be assigned a random number between 1 and 12.

A win will occur when the user has correctly matched the computer's guess and the game will refresh with all new random values.

***Currently needs de-bugging***
Not all values will randomly re-assign at gam restart.
It is possible for all even numbers to be chosen for the user's button options, 
while the computer can still guess an odd number, thus making it impossible to meet the win condition.


Made using JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap.
an optional styling touch- a playable song and controls at the bottom of the screen.
